Color coded files show the relative weight pixel values for each filter individually.
These can be created with "filter_visualizer_adapted.py".

non-color coded files (in a folder ..._rgb) show the absolute weight pixel values, normalized to 0..1.
These can be created with "filter_visualizer_adapted_rgb.py".
