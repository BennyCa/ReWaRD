# ReWaRD
Retinal Waves for Pre-Training Artificial Neural Networks Mimicking Real Prenatal Development

# Structure
This project provides different steps to make generation of retinal waves, pretraining a neural network and training it on image data easily accessible.\
1 - Generate Retinal Waves (Pretraining Data)\
2 - Prepare the retinal wave dataset for pre-training (train/val/test split), download fine-tuning dataset\
3a - Pretrain the Network on Retinal Waves\
3b - Fine-Tune = Train the Network for a specific Task on the fine-tuning dataset\
4 - Save checkpoints and visualize Filters\
5 - Evaluate on BrainScore

# Prerequisites

1 - gcc, Java\
2 - python\
3 - python3.7, GPU\
4 - python\
5 - python3.7


# Getting started
if you just want to fine tune a already pre-trained network, use a provided .pth and start with step 3b).
