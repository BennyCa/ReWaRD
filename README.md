# ReWaRD
Retinal Waves for Pre-Training Artificial Neural Networks Mimicking Real Prenatal Development

![ReWaRD Overview Figure](https://github.com/BennyCa/ReWaRD/blob/main/ReWaRD_Overview.png?raw=true)

# Structure
This project provides different steps to make generation of retinal waves, pretraining a neural network and training it on image data easily accessible.\
1 - Generate retinal waves (pre-training data)\
2 - Prepare the retinal wave dataset for pre-training (train/val/test split), download fine-tuning dataset\
3a - Pretrain the network on retinal waves\
3b - Fine-Tune = Train the network for a specific task on the fine-tuning dataset\
4 - Visualize filters on saved checkpoints\
5 - Evaluate on BrainScore

# Prerequisites

1 - gcc, Java\
2 - python\
3 - python3.7, GPU\
4 - python\
5 - python3.7

for exact prerequisites see subfolders.

# Getting started
if you just want to fine tune a already pre-trained network, use a provided .pth and start with step 3b).
